Sequence model


Imagine that you are watching movies on Netflix. As a good Netflix user, you decide to rate each of the movies religiously. After all, a good movie is a good movie, and you want to watch more of them, right? As it turns out, things are not quite so simple. People’s opinions on movies can change quite significantly over time. In fact, psychologists even have names for some of the effects:

There is anchoring, based on someone else’s opinion. For instance after the Oscar awards, ratings for the corresponding movie go up, even though it is still the same movie. This effect persists for a few months until the award is forgotten. [Wu et al., 2017] showed that the effect lifts rating by over half a point.

There is the Hedonic adaptation, where humans quickly adapt to accept an improved (or a bad) situation as the new normal. For instance, after watching many good movies, the expectations that the next movie is equally good or better are high, hence even an average movie might be considered a bad movie after many great ones.

There is seasonality. Very few viewers like to watch a Santa Claus movie in August.

In some cases movies become unpopular due to the misbehaviors of directors or actors in the production.

Some movies become cult movies, because they were almost comically bad. Plan 9 from Outer Space and Troll 2 achieved a high degree of notoriety for this reason.

In short, ratings are anything but stationary. Using temporal dynamics helped [Koren, 2009] to recommend movies more accurately. But it is not just about movies.

Many users have highly particular behavior when it comes to the time when they open apps. For instance, social media apps are much more popular after school with students. Stock market trading apps are more commonly used when the markets are open.

It is much harder to predict tomorrow’s stock prices than to fill in the blanks for a stock price we missed yesterday, even though both are just a matter of estimating one number. After all, foresight is so much harder than hindsight. In statistics, the former (predicting beyond the known observations) is called extrapolation whereas the latter (estimating between the existing observations) is called interpolation.

Music, speech, text, movies, steps, etc. are all sequential in nature. If we were to permute them they would make little sense. The headline dog bites man is much less surprising than man bites dog, even though the words are identical.

Earthquakes are strongly correlated, i.e., after a massive earthquake there are very likely several smaller aftershocks, much more so than without the strong quake. In fact, earthquakes are spatiotemporally correlated, i.e., the aftershocks typically occur within a short time span and in close proximity.

Humans interact with each other in a sequential nature, as can be seen in Twitter fights, dance patterns and debates.
